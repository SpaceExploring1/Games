I intended to make an aesthetically good quiz that is a fun thing to look at and just do for fun, for someone who wants to do a quiz. With a smooth ux/ui and a transition to the scorelist at the end without the use of a button after the quiz is complete. I love working with animations, effects and gradient backgrounds. And the animation from day to night shows how long you have for the quiz
